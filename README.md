Lower/Upper Quantiles & Meadians of both Target Income Types are not much different. Hence, observing the Age Distribution's Histogram, the Age groups dominating among Income < 50K over 80% of Average are from 15-40 years old. This could be due to early and middle stages of their career life and income. After the age of 45, there is a downturn for both Income Types. However, the dominant Age groups with Income >= 50K over 80% Average are from 30-55 years old. This could be people among elite groups with more stable income and wealthy classes.
